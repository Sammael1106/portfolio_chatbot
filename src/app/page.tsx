      <h3>Features</h3>
      <strong>Same API for WebP, JPEG & PNG images</strong>
      <p>The API compresses WebP, JPEG and PNG images. You only have to upload your source image and download the result. Everything else happens automatically.</p>

      <strong>Upload directly or provide a URL to the image</strong>
      <p>You can either upload images directly or specify a URL to the image you want to compress.</p>

      <strong>Convert images to WebP, JPEG or PNG (new)</strong>
      <p>Convert your images to another format, or ask the API to give you the smallest image format! Images with a transparent background can be filled with a color you specify.</p>

      <strong>Preserve metadata</strong>
      <p>You can choose to preserve copyright information, the GPS location and the creation date in the compressed JPEG images. For PNG images the copyright information can be preserved.</p>

      <strong>Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage (new)</strong>
      <p>You can instruct the API to save the optimized images directly in your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage buckets. When doing this you may also set custom Cache-Control and Expires headers.</p>

      <strong>Perfect image resizing</strong>
      <p>The API can resize your images as well as optimising them. You only have to upload the original once and then generate the image sizes you need. Resizing includes correct gamma scaling, bicubic transparency edge correction and natural image sharpening.</p>

      <strong>Area of interest detection</strong>
      <p>Take advantage of smart cropping to create thumbnails with different aspect ratios. The API will resize your images and crop away the parts that are visually the least interesting.</p>
